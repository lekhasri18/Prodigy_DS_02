This Python script performs a detailed analysis and visualization of population data from the World Bank dataset (2015). The script begins by loading the dataset from a CSV file located at "C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/2015.csv" using the pandas library. It then displays the first few rows of the dataset and provides basic information such as column names, data types, and non-null counts.

Data cleaning steps follow, where it checks for missing values across the dataset and drops rows containing any null values to ensure data integrity. The cleaned dataset, cleaned_data, is then used for subsequent analysis.

For exploratory data analysis (EDA), the script sets a seaborn style for plots and proceeds with several visualizations:

    Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of key variables like 'Happiness Score' and 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', showing their frequency distributions with kernel density estimates (KDE).
    A count plot illustrates the distribution of countries by region, providing insights into the geographic representation in the dataset.
    Scatter plots examine relationships between variables, such as 'Happiness Score' vs 'Economy (GDP per Capita)' and 'Happiness Score' vs 'Health (Life Expectancy)'. These plots are colored by region to highlight geographical patterns.
    A correlation heatmap is generated to visualize the pairwise correlations between numeric columns like 'Happiness Score', 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', 'Health (Life Expectancy)', and 'Freedom'. Annotations on the heatmap help interpret the strength and direction of these correlations.
    Finally, a pairplot is created to display pairwise relationships between the numerical variables, offering a comprehensive view of their distributions and correlations.

Each visualization is carefully designed using matplotlib and seaborn to provide clear insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships. This script serves as a practical guide for exploring and analyzing population data, facilitating further insights and decision-making processes based on the observed patterns and correlations.
